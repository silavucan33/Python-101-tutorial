#Membership operators = used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence
#                       (string, list, tuple, set, or dictionary)
#                       1. in
#                       2. not in

if letter in word:
    print(f"There is a {letter}")
else:

#searching for a value or a variable within a;
#STRING

#let's try a set (lists, tuples and sets are going to behave similarly)
