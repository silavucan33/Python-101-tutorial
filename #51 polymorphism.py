# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                Poly = Many
#                Morphe = Form

#                TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
#                1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#                2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods

shapes = [Circle(4), Square(5), Triangle(6, 7), Pizza("pepperoni", 15)]
#our pizza is considered a pizza. it inherits from the circle class. so it's also considered a circle. and our circle class inherits from the shape class

#Our pizza has three forms. Our pizza is considered a pizza, it's also considered a circle and it's also considered a shape
#It would make sense for it to fit into this list of shapes because our pizza also identifies as a shape.
